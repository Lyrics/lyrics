## Intro

The lyrics are stored in plain text, with no filename extension.

We avoid using "formulas" in lyrics. That means no things like `[x2]`, `[chorus]` or other ways to compress texts. The idea is basically to have a full text, which you can read as you listen to the song.

Having duplicate files is fine, as long as the artist really does have the same song across multiple albums. Using symlinks for that, however, is not a good idea. We've tried. It basically prevents the lyrics from being viewed easily via GitHub's interface and unnecessarily complicates things.

Any language is welcome, including translations. Most likely we'll put translations into `/translations/` which will mirror the `/database/` directory structure.

Punctuation marks are fine to use. Currently we use parenthesis to highlight that the bit is being sung by another voice.

Samples are harder to deal with. It's okay to skip them, but eventually we'll either create a separate `/samples/` directory for those, or put them inside square braces within the song text.

We stay away from censoring texts. This means it's okay to commit explicit words.

## Metadata

Metadata goes to the bottom of the song, under a sequence of underscores. Make it equal in length to the line of the first metadata field \(including its value\).

The name of the variable and the actual value are separated with two spaces.

### Possible metadata values

* Language - Contains language code \(how is this decided exactly, link people to some standard?\), can be multiple. If there are multiple, generally put the language the song is mainly in first, but if you can't decide, don't sweat it, the order is not that important.

## Example song

```text
I took a cheap shot,
A clean miss.
Burnin' my defenses by the shakin of her hips,

And then she
Moves in,
A quick kiss,
Breathing down my neck,
She had me wrapped around her wrist.

I try to
Break loose,
Tight grip,
Knocking me unconscious when she bit her bottom lip.

<<Major part of the song cut off here to not bloat the wiki page>>

Loaded the bullets with my blood in the rounds.
Yeah she's a sweet six shooter,
She knows how to get down.
Until the kick-back,
When my heart hits the ground.
She said,
"You think you're so tough,
Baby put your hands up."
Yeah.
